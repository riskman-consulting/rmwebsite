  "frequentlyAskedQuestions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What are ITGCs (IT General Controls)?",
      "answer": "ITGCs are the basic controls applied to secondary IT processes such as system security, change management, and IT operations. They ensure that business applications and computer systems are secure and reliable."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Why do ITACs (IT Application Controls) matter?",
      "answer": "ITACs ensure that transactions and data within specific software applications are accurate, complete, authorized, and valid. They are critical for ensuring the integrity of financial and operational data."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "How do IT controls support regulatory compliance?",
      "answer": "Most regulatory frameworks (like SOC 2, ISO 27001, or industry-specific audits) require evidence of robust IT controls. Effective ITGCs and ITACs provide the validation needed to pass these audits."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "What is the difference between ITGC and ITAC?",
      "answer": "ITGCs apply to the overall IT environment (like network security or server backups), while ITACs apply to specific business logic and data processing within a particular software application (like an automated invoice approval check)."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Can you help with SoD (Segregation of Duties) analysis?",
      "answer": "Yes, we perform deep-dive SoD reviews to ensure that no single individual has excessive control over a financial or operational process, which is a critical part of IT governance."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "What are the common ITGC gaps you find?",
      "answer": "Common gaps include excessive administrative privileges, lack of formal change approval documentation, and inconsistent monitoring of job failures or backups."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "How often should IT controls be tested?",
      "answer": "We recommend at least annual testing for most controls, though critical systems may require periodic or continuous monitoring to ensure ongoing compliance."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "How long does an ITGC assessment typically take?",
      "answer": "A standard assessment usually takes 4-8 weeks, depending on the number of systems in scope and the complexity of the IT environment."
