      "question": "How long does it take to achieve SOC 2 compliance?",

      "id": 3,
      "question": "Do we need SOC 1 or SOC 2?",
      "answer": "SOC 1 is for organizations that impact financial reporting of user entities. SOC 2 is for service providers handling customer data. Your choice depends on your business model and client requirements."

    {
      "id": 4,

      "question": "Can you help with both Type 1 and Type 2 reports?",
