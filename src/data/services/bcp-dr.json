  "frequentlyAskedQuestions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What is the difference between BCP and DR?",
      "answer": "BCP (Business Continuity Planning) focuses on keeping business operations running during a disruption, while DR (Disaster Recovery) specifically targets the technical recovery of IT systems, applications, and data."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Why is BCP critical for my organization?",
      "answer": "BCP ensures that your critical business functions continue even during unexpected events like natural disasters, cyberattacks, or supply chain failures, protecting your revenue and reputation."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "How often should BCP and DR plans be tested?",
      "answer": "We recommend at least annual testing, with more frequent simulations for high-risk or rapidly changing environments. Testing validates that your plans actually work when needed."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "What are RTO and RPO?",
      "answer": "RTO (Recovery Time Objective) is the maximum acceptable time to restore a system after a failure. RPO (Recovery Point Objective) is the maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time (e.g., losing the last 15 minutes of data)."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Do you help with ISO 22301 certification?",
      "answer": "Yes, we help organizations design and implement continuity management systems that align with and achieve ISO 22301 certification."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "Can you support remote workforce continuity?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Modern BCP must account for remote work scenarios, ensuring that employees can securely access critical systems from anywhere during a disruption."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "What is a Business Impact Analysis (BIA)?",
      "answer": "A BIA is a systematic process to determine the potential effects of an interruption to critical business operations as a result of a disaster, accident, or emergency."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "How does RiskMan handle crisis communication planning?",
      "answer": "We develop structured communication protocols, including call trees and notification systems, to ensure all stakeholders receive timely and accurate information during an incident."
